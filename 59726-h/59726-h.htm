  VISION<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I've seen her, I've seen her<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath an apple-tree;<br />
  The minute that I saw her there<br />
  With stars and dewdrops in her hair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew it must be she.<br />
  She's sitting on a dragon-fly<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shining green and gold;<br />
  The dragon-fly goes circling round<br />
  A little way above the ground&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She isn't taking hold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I've seen her, I've seen her,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never, never knew<br />
  That anything could be so sweet;<br />
  She has the tiniest hands and feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wings are very blue.<br />
  She holds her little head like <i>this</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is a queen;<br />
  (I can't describe it all in words)<br />
  She's throwing kisses to the birds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughing in between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I've seen her, I've seen her&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply ran and ran;<br />
  Put down your sewing quickly, please,<br />
  Let's hurry to the orchard trees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As softly as we can.<br />
  I had to go and leave her there,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt I couldn't stay,<br />
  I wanted you to see her too&mdash;<br />
  But oh, whatever shall we do<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she has flown away?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="please"></a></p>

<h3>
  PLEASE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Please be careful where you tread,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairies are about;<br />
  Last night, when I had gone to bed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard them creeping out.<br />
  And wouldn't it be a dreadful thing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do a fairy harm?<br />
  To crush a little delicate wing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bruise a tiny arm?<br />
  They're all about the place, I know,<br />
  So do be careful where you go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Please be careful what you say,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're often very near,<br />
  And though they turn their heads away<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot help but hear.<br />
  And think how terribly you would mind<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, even for a joke,<br />
  You said a thing that seemed unkind<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the dear little fairy folk.<br />
  I'm sure they're simply everywhere,<br />
  So <i>promise</i> me that you'll take care.<br />

<h3>
  THE DAPHNE BUSH<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  All about the daphne bush the happy fairies went,<br />
  And spread abroad their silken hair to catch its magic scent;<br />
  They chanted little silver tunes, they danced the whole day long;<br />
  The rosy bush was ringed around with chains  of coloured song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They danced, they sang, they flung about their tiny fairy names,<br />
  Till swiftly over all the sky there ran the sunset flames;<br />
  Then high into the glowing air they leapt with joyful shout,<br />
  And with the ruddy shreds of mist they wrapped themselves about.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Into my quiet garden close they swiftly dropped again<br />
  (The music of their merriment tinkled like falling rain);<br />
  Laughing they swayed, while from their hair they shook the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warm perfume,<br />
  Till all the place seemed filled with clouds of drifting<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daphne bloom.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
  ALMS IN AUTUMN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Spindle-wood, spindle-wood, will you lend me, pray,<br />
  A little flaming lantern to guide me on my way?<br />
  The fairies all have vanished from the meadow and the glen<br />
  And I would fain go seeking till I find them once again.<br />
  Lend me now a lantern that I may bear a light<br />
  To find the hidden pathway in the darkness of the night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ash-tree, ash-tree, throw me, if you please,<br />
  Throw me down a slender bunch of russet-gold keys.<br />
  I fear the gates of Fairyland may all be shut so fast<br />
  That nothing but your magic keys will ever take me past.<br />
  I'll tie them to my girdle, and as I go along<br />
  My heart will find a comfort in the tinkle of their song.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Holly-bush, holly-bush, help me in my task,<br />
  A pocketful of berries is all the alms I ask:<br />
  A pocketful of berries to thread in glowing strands<br />
  (I would not go a-visiting with nothing in my hands)<br />
  So fine will be the rosy chains, so gay, so glossy bright<br />
  They'll set the realms of Fairyland all dancing with delight.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="fairy"></a></p>

<h3>
  FAIRY MUSIC<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When the fiddlers play their tunes you may sometimes hear,<br />
  Very softly chiming in, magically clear,<br />
  Magically high and sweet, the tiny crystal notes<br />
  Of fairy voices bubbling free from tiny fairy throats.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When the birds at break of day chant their morning prayers,<br />
  Or on sunny afternoons pipe ecstatic airs,<br />
  Comes an added rush of sound to the silver din&mdash;<br />
  Songs of fairy troubadours gaily joining in.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When athwart the drowsy fields summer twilight falls,<br />
  Through the tranquil air there float elfin madrigals<br />
  And in wild November nights, on the winds astride,<br />
  Fairy hosts go rushing by, singing as they ride.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Every dream that mortals dream, sleeping or awake,<br />
  Every lovely fragile hope&mdash;these the fairies take,<br />
  Delicately fashion them and give them back again<br />
  In tender, limpid melodies that charm the hearts of men.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="hayfield"></a></p>

<h3>
  THE HAYFIELD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Over the field the fairies went<br />
  Singing and dancing and well content;<br />
  Over the field of sweet warm grass<br />
  I saw their shimmering cohorts pass.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The clover flamed to a ruddier glow,<br />
  The slender buttercups curtseyed low,<br />
  The wondering daisies, innocent-eyed,<br />
  Bowed their heads to the radiant tide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And flirting butterflies, pearly white,<br />
  Left the flowers for a new delight,<br />
  Left their loves for the fairies' sake,<br />
  And fluttered dizzily in their wake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Over the swaying grass they swept,<br />
  Over the hedgerow soared and leapt,<br />
  Broke and scattered in golden spray,<br />
  Gleamed and glittered&mdash;and melted away.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="island"></a></p>

<h3>
  THE ISLAND<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I know an island in a lake,<br />
  Green upon waters grey;<br />
  It has a strange enchanted air;<br />
  I hear the fairies singing there<br />
  When I go by that way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They guard their hidden dwelling-place<br />
  With bands of stalwart reeds,<br />
  But sometimes, by a happy chance,<br />
  I see them all come out and dance<br />
  Upon the water-weeds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One night, one summer night, I know<br />
  Suddenly I shall wake,<br />
  And very softly hasten down<br />
  And out beyond the sleeping town<br />
  To find my fairy lake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I shall not need to seek a boat,<br />
  It will be moored, I think,<br />
  Within a tiny pebbled bay<br />
  Where meadow-sweet and mallow sway<br />
  Close to the water's brink.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The moon from shore to shadowy shore<br />
  Will make a shining trail,<br />
  And I shall sing their fairy song<br />
  As joyfully I float along&mdash;<br />
  I shall not need a sail.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And peering through a starlit haze<br />
  I presently shall see,<br />
  Where swift the waiting reeds unclose,<br />
  The fairies all in rows and rows<br />
  Waiting to welcome me.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  SMITH SQUARE, WESTMINSTER
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  In Smith Square, Westminster, the houses stand so prim,<br />
  With slender railings at their feet and windows straight and slim;<br />
  And all day long they staidly stare with gentle placid gaze,<br />
  And dream of joyous happenings in splendid bygone days.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In Smith Square, Westminster, you must not make a noise,<br />
  No shrill-voiced vendors harbour there, no shouting errand-boys;<br />
  But very busy gentlemen step swiftly out and in<br />
  With little leather cases and umbrellas neatly thin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet sometimes when the summer night her starry curtain spreads,<br />
  And all the busy gentlemen are sleeping in their beds,<br />
  You hear a gentle humming like the humming of a hive,<br />
  And Smith Square, Westminster, begins to come alive.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For all the houses start to sing, honey-sweet and low,<br />
  The tender little lovely songs of long and long ago,<br />
  And all the fairies round about come hastening up in crowds,<br />
  Until the quiet air is filled with rainbow-coloured clouds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On roof and rail and chimney-pot they delicately perch,<br />
  They hang like jewelled fringes on the ledges of the church;<br />
  They dance about the roadway upon nimble, noiseless feet,<br />
  While the houses keep on chanting with a soft enticing beat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And still they weave their sparkling webs and still they<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leap and whirl<br />
  Until the far horizon's edge is faintly rimmed with pearl,<br />
  And the morning breeze blows out the stars discreetly, one by one,<br />
  And the sentries on the Abbey signal down&mdash;"The Sun&mdash;the Sun!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And long before the butlers stumble drowsily downstairs,<br />
  And long before their masters have begun to say their prayers,<br />
  The fairies all have pranced away upon the morning beams,<br />
  And Smith Square, Westminster, is wrapped once more in dreams.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  THE ENCHANTED PRINCESS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  She wanders in the forest with wide and solemn eyes;<br />
  A little shade of wilderment across her forehead lies.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No timid woodland creature her footfall need affright,<br />
  The shadow of her floating hair is not more soft and light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She hears the gentle cadence of bird and wind and stream,<br />
  They make a little song for her, like singing in a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Across the distant valley the pleasant sunbeams fall;<br />
  The children in the cowslip field merrily laugh and call.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She does not hear their laughter, she does not feel the sun,<br />
  She cannot leave the shadowed wood until the spell is done.<br />

<h3>
  THE GOBLIN TO THE FAIRY QUEEN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  What do you lack, queen, queen,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is precious and fine and rare?<br />
  A jewelled snood that shall lie between<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delicate waves of your hair?<br />
  I will ride through the sky on the evening wind<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a golden needle and thread,<br />
  And string up the tiniest stars I can find,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To glitter about your head.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What can I do, queen, queen,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hasten the hours along<br />
  When you grow weary of woodland green,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of woodland song?<br />
  A cage of gossamer gold I will tie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to a skylark's wing,<br />
  And there you shall hang in the midst of the sky<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tremble to hear him sing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Grant me a boon, queen, queen;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the boon that I ask&mdash;<br />
  Let me do service, mighty or mean,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me a task, a task.<br />
  Are there no jackanapes giants to slay?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there no dragons to fight?<br />
  Nothing shall daunt me by dark or by day;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make me your goblin knight!<br />

  THE FAIRY QUEEN TO THE GOBLIN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Last night I heard a singing&mdash;a singing in my dreams,<br />
  It wandered through my land of sleep like little silver streams;<br />
  Like little purling silver streams that gently laugh and coo&mdash;<br />
  Goblin with the shining eyes, goblin, was it you?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Softer than the tender croon of my happy doves,<br />
  Sweeter than my nightingales pouring forth their loves,<br />
  Clearer than my valiant lark triumphant in the blue;<br />
  Goblin with the whimsic smile, goblin, was it you?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All night long the singer stayed close beside my bower,<br />
  Weaving his enchanted songs, till that magic hour<br />
  When the early morning light creeps across the dew;<br />
  Goblin with the steadfast heart, goblin, was it you?<br />

<p class="poem">
  As I walked over Hollybush Hill<br />
  The sun was low and the winds were still,<br />
  And never a whispering branch I heard<br />
  Nor ever the tiniest call of a bird.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when I came to the topmost height<br />
  Oh, but I saw such a wonderful sight:<br />
  All about on the hill-crest there<br />
  The fairies danced in the golden air.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Danced and frolicked with never a sound<br />
  In and out in a magical round;<br />

  Tiny riders on tiny steeds,<br />
  Decked with blossoms and armed with reeds,<br />
  With gossamer banners floating far<br />
  And a radiant queen in an ivory car.<br />

  The beeches spread their petticoats wide<br />

  When the queer wee folk who live on the moors<br />

  Laughing and chattering all together,<br />
  He looks askance at their rollicking play<br />

  "You're a feather-brained, foolish, frivolous pack,<br />

  But little enough they heed his shout,<br />

  Yours is any happy line,<br />
  All that's done amiss is mine.<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
